So to begin with I created an ELK virtual machine and connected it to the RedTeam VM through peering. Then the JumpBox i created was given specfic set of rules 1. Denying all incoming traffic and 2. Whitelisting my home IP address so only i could access the VM and 3. Only using port 22 through ansible to access my JumpBox. I created an ssh key to allow access into the JumpBox and the other VMs I created. To connect to the JumpBox i ssh'd into the machine using ssh returntrip@23.96.51.253 I then connected Web-1 and Web-2 VMs to the Jumpbox in which i previous install docker.io in the ansible format, after installing the docker and doing a ssh returntrip@10.1.0.5 which was one of my Web VMs i was then able to get into that machine through the Jumpbox. I wrote the script for the Ansible Playbook so that my VM would now run on ansible allowing me to connect to any VM i created through that container. I then was able to link the ELK stack to Kibana using port 5601 which gave my VM access to the Kibana webpage and information. In conclusion I created a network that only my IP address was able to access and each were connected with each other, thus creating a secure network in which i would be able to access all my machines through 1 container.
